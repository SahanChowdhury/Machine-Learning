This is a project comparing Decision trees to Random Forest on a weather dataset.

Seattle-weather.csv - Contains the main dataset 

There are a number of files;

dataLoading.m - contains entire code (This does not need to be used)

1) DataPreprocessing.m - Contains the section of pre processed data

data_copy.csv - contains the formatted dataset ready to be applied to the models

2)TrainingDT.m - trains the decision tree model 

decisionTree_HP.mat - contains the final optimised model of decision tree

3) TestingDT.m - Test the optimised decision tree model

4)TrainingRF.m - Trains the random forest model

RandomForest_HP.mat - Contains the optimised random forest model

5) TestingRF.m - Contains the testing and evaluation metrics of the optimised rf model on testing data.

training_data.mat - contains the training dataset

test_data.mat - contains the testing dataset.


Start by loading each m file, and run the code entirely.
